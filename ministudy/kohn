TITLE: Security breach at airport commuter terminal leads to suspect’s death

There was a security breach at the Island Air commuter terminal at the Honolulu International Airport before dawn Saturday and the unarmed man who forced his way into a secured area later died at the hospital.

The scene unfolded just before 6 a.m.

Dept. of Transportation spokesman Tim Sakahara says the man was in his 40s and didn’t have a weapon in his possession. He was caught seconds after he went through an exit outside the terminal building and onto the tarmac.

Sakahara said the suspect “was even combative once he was detained, so there was still a struggle … and after that point, he became unresponsive and was transported (to the hospital).” Life-saving measures were initially initiated at the scene by the Honolulu Fire Department, EMS and Airport Rescue Fire Fighters.

Several law enforcement officers, including those with Securitas, State Sheriffs and the Transportation Security Administration, teamed up to catch the unarmed man. One officer with Securitas, a security agency hired by the DOT, was the first to make contact with the suspect and is in the hospital with head injuries.

Police were there for several hours investigating the scene. Airport store worker Anne Tolentino said “I came in 8 o’clock, and opened the store, so there were a lot of police cars outside.”

Sakahara said the suspect did not have a ticket and an investigation is ongoing as to how long he was at the airport previous to the incident and where he was going.

An Island Air spokesperson sent us a statement saying “we are cooperating with the appropriate authorities as they investigate this incident.”

Honolulu police have opened an unattended death investigation. An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday. The suspect remains unidentified.

The incident had no impact on flight operations at the airport.
