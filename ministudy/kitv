TITLE: TSA breach at Honolulu International Airport leaves one man dead

A man in his 40s is dead after breaking past a TSA security checkpoint at Honolulu International Airport on Saturday.
It happened just after 5:45 a.m. at the commuter terminal where Island Air and Mokulele Airlines operate. 

After entering the terminal, the man forced his way through an exit lane of the security checkpoint to a secured area where ticketed passengers were waiting to board. The suspect was taken into custody seconds later. 
Several law enforcement agencies responded, including Securitas Law Enforcement Officers, State Sheriffs and TSA officers. 
After being detained, the man became unresponsive. 

"Immediately, life saving techniques were initiated on the man and he was transported to a hospital, where he was later pronounced deceased." said Tim Sakahara, DOT spokesperson. 

One male law enforcement officer suffered head injuries during the struggle. He was taken to the hospital where he was treated. 
A woman working near the TSA checkpoint expressed concerns over the incident. 

"I felt scared because when they said it happened at 6, I had to open this door at 8. So I said oh good thing it happened before I opened." said Annejoan Tolentino.

DOT officials confirmed the suspect was not armed.  There is no word on whether drugs or alcohol were factors. 
Security checkpoints operations at the commuter terminal were temporarily suspended during the incident. No flights coming in or out were impacted. 
The Honolulu Police Department has opened an unattended death investigation. 
The suspect's identity has not yet been released.
