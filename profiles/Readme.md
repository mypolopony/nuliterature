### Data Sources

Here is where profiles go. They are generally made with either `wget` or `httrack` -- I find that, even restricting to .html alone, these mirrors can get pretty large. Unfortunately, for reasons, these cannot be uploaded to Github.

I'll try to put a list of sources here at a later date.
